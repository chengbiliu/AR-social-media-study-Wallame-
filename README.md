# AR-social-media-study-Wallame-
Python scripts and one Matlab script used for my doctoral research on AR-based social media. The functions include data scraping, data cleaning, text detection and extraction (supported by Google OCR), sentiment analysis (supported by Google NLP), and visual metric computation. The computed variables were fed into an OLS model and a geographically weighted regression model to predict user sentiment based on environmental visual charactersitics.
